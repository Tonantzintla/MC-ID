MC-ID is a Minecraft authentication and identification service that allows users to securely log in to third-party websites and applications using their Minecraft account.

It provides a simple and secure way to authorize, identify, and/or verify users via Minecraft, without using sensitive tokens unlike Microsoft OAuth2; which grants access to the user's Minecraft account and therefore easily used for malicious purposes.
