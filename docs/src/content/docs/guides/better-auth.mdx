# Better-Auth Integration

MC-ID is built using `better-auth` and is fully compatible with it.

## Configuration

Use the generic `oidc` provider in your `better-auth` configuration.

<Aside type="tip">Ensure you have the `oidc` plugin installed and configured in your `better-auth` setup.</Aside>

<Code code={`
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { oidc } from "better-auth/plugins";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    oidc({
      providers: [
        {
          id: "mc-id",
          name: "MC-ID",
          clientId: process.env.MCID_CLIENT_ID,
          clientSecret: process.env.MCID_CLIENT_SECRET,
          issuer: "https://mc-id.com/api/auth",
          authorizationUrl: "https://mc-id.com/api/auth/oauth2/authorize",
          tokenUrl: "https://mc-id.com/api/auth/oauth2/token",
          userInfoUrl: "https://mc-id.com/api/auth/oauth2/userinfo",
          scopes: ["profile", "email", "connections"],
        }
      ]
    })
  ]
});`} lang="typescript" />
