# Getting Started with MC-ID

MC-ID is an open-source identity provider that allows users to authenticate using their Minecraft accounts, verifying ownership securely and easily.

## How it Works

MC-ID implements **OAuth 2.1** with **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**. This means it works just like "Login with Google" or "Login with Discord", but for Minecraft.

<Steps>

1.  **User initiates login:** The user clicks "Login with MC-ID" on your application.
2.  **Redirect:** Your app redirects the user to the MC-ID authorization page with PKCE parameters.
3.  **Consent:** The user reviews and approves the requested permissions.
4.  **Callback:** MC-ID redirects the user back to your app with an authorization code.
5.  **Token Exchange:** Your app exchanges the code (with the PKCE verifier) for an ID token and access token containing the user's Minecraft profile.

</Steps>

<Aside type="note">**PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)** is mandatory for all authorization requests. This provides additional security by ensuring that only the application that initiated the flow can complete it. Most OIDC libraries handle this automatically.</Aside>

## Recommended Integration

We **strongly recommend** using the standard OAuth 2.1/OIDC flow for most applications.

## Headless Mode

For advanced use cases where a web redirect is not possible (e.g., CLI tools, desktop apps, in-game mods), MC-ID offers a Headless API. However, this requires you to handle the verification lifecycle manually and is **discouraged** for standard web applications.
