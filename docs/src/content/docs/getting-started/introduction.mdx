# Getting Started with MC-ID

MC-ID is an open-source identity provider that allows users to authenticate using their Minecraft accounts, verifying ownership securely and easily.

## How it Works

MC-ID implements the **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** standard. This means it works just like "Login with Google" or "Login with Discord", but for Minecraft.

<Steps>

1.  **User initiates login:** The user clicks "Login with MC-ID" on your application.
2.  **Redirect:** Your app redirects the user to the MC-ID authorization page.
3.  **Callback:** MC-ID redirects the user back to your app with an authorization code.
4.  **Token Exchange:** Your app exchanges the code for an ID token and access token containing the user's Minecraft profile.

</Steps>

## Recommended Integration

We **strongly recommend** using the standard OIDC flow (Normal Mode) for most applications.

## Headless Mode

For advanced use cases where a web redirect is not possible (e.g., CLI tools, desktop apps), MC-ID offers a Headless API. However, this requires you to handle the verification lifecycle manually and is **discouraged** for standard web applications.
