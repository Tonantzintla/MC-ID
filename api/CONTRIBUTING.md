## Prerequisites

Before contributing, please ensure you have the following:

- A basic understanding of TypeScript and NestJS
- A development environment set up with Node.js and pnpm
- A GitHub account to submit pull requests.

Software Requirements:

- Node.js version 22.x or higher
- pnpm version 10.x or higher

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine
3. Install the dependencies using `pnpm install`
4. Start the development server with `pnpm start:dev`

## Notes

It's heavily recommended to use the [MC-ID Plugin](https://github.com/Tonantzintla/MC-ID-Plugin) locally when testing the API. As the plugin relies on the API to retrieve the 6-digit code, having a running instance of the plugin will allow you to test the API's full functionality effectively.
